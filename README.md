# Category Theory Reading Group

Welcome! This repository hosts materials for the **Category Theory Reading Group**.

---

## Motivation

Category theory is an amazingly elegant framework for systematic abstract thinking.  
For some, it offers an alternative foundation of mathematics beyond set theory;  
for others, it provides the most natural setting for formalizing physics;  
and for yet others, it serves as the language connecting logic and computation.  
— and the list goes on.

The goals of this reading group are:
1. To become acquainted with the basic principles of category theory.  
2. To explore how these principles can be applied to problems in your own area of interest.

## Organisation

We will meet weekly (most likely at the **LMU Central Building**).  
The exact time is yet to be decided — you can submit your availability [here](https://timeful.app/e/Cad69).

Each week, we will hold a session covering a topic in category theory.  
There will be an associated reading for each session, but participants are *not required* to read it in advance.

I am prepared to lead all of the sessions, but volunteers are very welcome — especially for **Part II**, where you could show how Category Theory applies to your field.

The readings are divided into two parts:

---

## Part I: Basics of Category Theory

In this part, we introduce the definition of categories and explore some essential categorical constructions.  
The two main references are **Goldblatt's [Topoi](https://projecteuclid.org/ebooks/books-by-independent-authors/Topoi-The-Categorial-Analysis-of-Logic/toc/bia/1403013939)** and **Awodey's [Category Theory](https://www.hlaszny.com/booksAndPapers/buckets/b9_mathematics/CategoryTheory.pdf)**.

**Topics:**
- The definition of a category, its philosophical motivations, and examples  
- Initial objects and products  
- Exponential objects  
- Functors  
- Natural transformations  
- Adjointness

## Part II: Applications of Category Theory

In this part, we apply the machinery developed in Part I to problems in specific domains —  
for instance, philosophy, foundations of mathematics, logic, and physics. 

You can submitt your topics of interrest [here](https://forms.gle/yqcQ2SDF9KUzzCFa6)

**Topics:**  
_To be announced_
