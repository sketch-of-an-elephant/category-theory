# Category Theory Reading Group

This repository hosts materials for the **Category Theory Reading Group**.

Each week we will hold a session covering some topic in category theory.  
There will be a reading associated with each session, but participants are *not required* to read it in advance.

The readings are divided into two parts:

---

## Part I: Basics of Category Theory

In this part, we cover the definition of categories and some essential categorical constructions.

**Topics:**
- The definition of a category, its philosophical motivations, and examples  
- Initial objects and products  
- Exponential objects  
- Functors  
- Natural transformations  
- Adjointness

## Part II: Applications of Category Theory

In this part, we take the machinery covered in Part I and look at applications to problems in specific domains — e.g. philosophy, foundations of mathematics, logic, and physics.

**Topics:**  
_To be announced_

I am prepared to lead all of the sessions, but you are very welcome to volunteer — especially for **Part II**, where you could show how Category Theory might apply to your area of interest.
